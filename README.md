## Projects
### Sentiment Analysis of Café Reviews Using Machine Learning and Streamlit Deployment

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of cafés using supervised machine learning algorithms. I built a sentiment classification model using three different algorithms **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Naïve Bayes** to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments. Additionally, I developed a rule-based text categorization method to group sentiments into key aspects such as service, menu, price, and facilities. The final solution was deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input text or document and view visualization and categorized sentiment. This project highlights my skills in **NLP**, **model evaluation**, and **real-time app deployment**.

### House Price Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and more. The workflow included data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost** etc. and compared their performance using **R² score**, **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE** as evaluation metrics. This project demonstrates my skills in **regression modeling**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **data pipeline building**.
